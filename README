./oss

Project 4
Alex Kane 4/12/2018

This project simulates the execution of a operating system that manages the allocation of scarce resources to several child processes.  The bankers algorithm is carried out on every request to detect if a request will cause the system to enter an unsafe state.

The parent should terminate after 2 seconds.  Children are set to terminate after 4 seconds, in the case that they are not properly killed by oss.

The program may be executed using ./oss.  ./oss -v causes verbose loggint to be used instead.

Children processes don't always seem to be terminating correctly.
